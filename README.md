### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mainly working on corporate Docker based apps with Angular (usually complex container structure), which makes work easier for others.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m intersted in all new web frameworks, deployed crypto contracts and taming dev-ops monsters. Learning never stops.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send a message to ![](./contact.svg)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started a developer career because I was too lazy for a repetitive task as a kid. And I still love to automate things.
